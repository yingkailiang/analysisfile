Color Contrast Analyzer Extension for Google Chrome

Notes on the Code

Some of this code is from another project from Google.

I used the code from this project for creating the draggable selection box. This code has lots of other functionality, most of which I have removed. There could still be some remnants of this code that is basically dormant in the Color Contrast Analyzer at this point.
