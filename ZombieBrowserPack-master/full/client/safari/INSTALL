The safari extension can be created from the chrome extension.

You have to remove the cookieEvent function, because there is no API in Safari to access cookies (only via plain javascript :-( ). Also remove the native client module from the background.html. Pack the extension into crx, upload it into www.extensionfactory.com/labs/conversion and download the functional Safari extension 

You also have to rename the browser type from chrome to safari in the background.js here:
+ encodeURIComponent("Chrome") 
-->  
+ encodeURIComponent("Safari")
