Installation instructions:
Step 1. Copy the contents of the webroot folder into a local webserver webroot. PHP (4 or 5) is only needed if you want to receive the passwords from postdata and the cookies. Check the php file permissions - the web server user should be the owner and should have read privileges, and write privileges in the folder. 
Step 2. Start the webserver, check if http://127.0.0.1/c/1.json is reachable from the victim browser.
Step 3. Install the extensions into the browsers. Simple drag-and-drop should work, or open the corresponding extension in the victim browser. Firefox has to be restarted.
Step 4. Modify c/1.json in the webserver webroot to control the clients via JavaScript. Always increment jscommandid if you want to issue a new command. Escape special characters like " with \ .
Step 5. Check the addcookie and addpostinfo folder for the cookie and password values.

Limitations: 
1. Firefox and Chrome only steals the two-factor authentication cookies from Google and Facebook (built-in limitation)
2. Safari is not able to steal the cookies (cookies not protected via httponly could be stolen via javascript)
3. The browsers show the user password in an alert box for the victim (built-in feature)

Known bugs: 
1. After reinstalling the plugins, sometimes the jscommandid has to be set to a greater value than used before, don't use 1 or 2 as jscommandid.
2. Firefox will leave flashX.dat and flashX1.dat files in the users profile directory, even after uninstalling the extension.
