Download Master
====

Download Master is a chrome extension that simplifies the process of organizing downloads. A download
is organized by the URL it came from and its file type. The user provides a specific path for a URL,
and when the file is downloaded from that URL it is automatically put into the user selected folder.
The downloads are further organized into folders by their file type(pdf,doc,exe,txt, etc.). If the
a the URL of a downloaded file doesn't reside in the user's data base, the download is put into
the default folder. The extension also suggests download folders based on what is already stored
in memory.

The extension only works on windows computers right now. I am working on porting it to Linux
and MacOS.
