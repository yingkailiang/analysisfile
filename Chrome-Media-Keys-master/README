Extension for people that listen to music on the web to map shortcuts to music player actions. Currently only works for thesixtyone.com.

How it works:
- inject.js injected into all tabs, listens for keystroke (F7 - F9)
- t61.js injected into thesixtyone.com, listens for messages from inject.js and reacts accordingly

V2:
- let people bind their own keystrokes
- option: if not loaded, load music player on play (optionally, in pinned tab)

V3:
- option: on song change, show background page with name of new song
	(impl: hard... poll for song change?)
- support other music services (?)
