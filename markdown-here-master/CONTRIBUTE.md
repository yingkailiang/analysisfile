## Translation

We use Crowdin for crowd-sourced translation. If you visit the [Markdown Here Crowdin project page](https://crowdin.net/project/markdown-here) you'll find that it's quite easy to contribute. Feel free to add new translations, improve existing ones, or even create new language categories.

If you do make any translation changes, or if you have any questions or problems, please post to the MDH Google Group or create a Github issue. (I can't figure out a way to get notified when translations are updated, so you'll have to let me know that there are new ones to integrate.)
