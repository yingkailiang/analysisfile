Chrome RSS Subscription Extension
=========

This is a fork of the now discontinued RSS Subscription Extension for Chrome by Google

With the annoucement of the end of Google Reader, 
Google removed their RSS Subscription Extension from the Chrome webstore.

This fork removes the previous list of rss readers (Google Reader, iGoogle, My Yahoo) and replaces them
with modern well supported web-based RSS readers (Feedly, NewsBlur and TheOldReader)

This extension is published on the chrome webstore at:
