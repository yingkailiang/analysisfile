Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## How to use wasavi with Vimperator on Firefox

Put [wasavi_mediator.js](https://raw.github.com/akahuku/wasavi/master/mediators/vimperator/wasavi_mediator.js) in your Vimperator plugin directory, for example,  `~/.vimperator/plugin` or `%HOME%\vimperator\plugin`.

This plugin will control the pass-through mode of Vimperator according to the state of wasavi.

On [wasavi online app](http://wasavi.appsweets.net/), enter `:ignorekeys add ^http://wasavi\\.appsweets\\.net/` in Vimperator. Then Vimperator will always use pass-through mode for the online app. `ignorekeys` settings is stored automatically therefore you will not have to reenter it.


## How to use wasavi as an independent text editor

Install wasavi extension and open the link to [wasavi online app](http://wasavi.appsweets.net/). wasavi will start automatically. You can use ex commands `:read`, `:write`, `:edit` or `:file` to access your Dropbox/Google Drive files. You will have to authorize wasavi via OAuth to access these storages.

Tips and Tricks
===============

* to maximize the wasavi: `:set fullscreen` or `:set fs`
* to restore the wasavi: `:set nofullscreen` or `:set nofs`
* to change a color theme: `:set theme=blight` or `:set theme=charcoal`
* to modify initial settings:
  open preference wasavi extension (or enter `:options` on wasavi), and edit "exrc" textbox.
* abbreviate syntax is
	+ `:abbreviate` displays all the abbreviations currently registered.
	+ `:abbreviate [clear]` clears all the abbreviations.
	+ `:abbreviate lhs` displays the abbreviation corresponding to lhs.
	+ `:abbreviate lhs rhs` registers a abbreviation which
	  expands lhs to rhs.
* map syntax is
	+ `:map` displays all the mappings currently registered.
	+ `:map [clear]` clears all the mappings.
	+ `:map lhs rhs` registers a rule which translates lhs to rhs. Its translation is recursive.
	+ `:map [noremap] lhs rhs` also registers, but it is
	  non-recursive.
	+ `:map` targets the normal mode mappings. On the other hand,
	  `:map!` targets the insert mode.
* j k ^ $ moves cursor by physical row, on the other hand,
  gj gk g^ g$ moves by wrapped row. To swap the behavior: `:set jkdenotative`
* f/F/t/T extension for Japanese: these commands recognizes reading (ro-ma ji
  expression) of hiragana, katakana, and kanji. For example, `fk` will place
  a cursor on 'æ¼¢'.
* use a online storage as file system:
	+ `:filesystem status` shows all file systems currently available.
	+ `:filesystem default` shows default file system. You can set default file system
	  via `:filesystem default dropbox` or `:filesystem default gdrive`.
	+ `:filesystem reset` discards the access token for online storage.
	+ You can place the file system name at the head of a file name explicitly:
	  for instance, `:read dropbox:/hello.txt`.
