## ToDo

* `[Bug]` Emote title text reveal doesn't seem to work in live preview (Firefox only?).
* `[Bug]` Quotation marks for list names are bad and break things. There is a reeeaaally weird bug, where a variable suddenly becomes unusable and I have no idea what's going on. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and don't use quotation marks for the time being.
