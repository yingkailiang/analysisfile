/* Dummy.
 * Opera includes the files "includes/mle-codes.js" and "scripts/options.js" in its "options.html".
 * However, that's not how it works in Firefox. But I want to re-use the same "options.html" file.
 * So in Firefox in "includes/" and "scripts/" are just dummy files without actual content.
 *
 * The actual mle-codes.js and options.js are in the directory above.
