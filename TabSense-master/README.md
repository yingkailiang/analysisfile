TabSense is a Google Chrome extension that helps you manage your Tabs

What is TabSense?
=================

TabSense is primarily inspired by Firefox's Tab Candy concept.

While browsing in Chrome, we end up with tens of tabs spread across many windows. TabSense replaces your newtab page with a summary view of all these tabs. Each time you open a new tab, it will be populated with tabs organized by their parent windows.


It is still a WORK IN PROGRESS. More features remain to be added. (tab movement between windows, searching through tabs)
